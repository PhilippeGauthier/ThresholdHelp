        <a id="introduction"><h1>Billing / Project Management</h1></a>
        <p>In this section you’ll learn everything there is to know about how to manage your paid Threshold projects.</p>
        <p>If there are issues you can't resolve by reading these documents feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@383studio.com" >support@383studio.com</a>.</p>
        <div id="getting-started" class="subsection">
          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>This section covers how the 45 day free trial works, recommended methods for managing your project’s billing cycles, definition of the Threshold project owner, and the method/types of payment that are accepted.   </p>
          <h3>How does the 45 day free trial work?</h3>
          <p>Each user gets one 45 day free trial project. If you sign up for a paying project right off the bat, you have 45 days to try Threshold before we ever charge you a penny. If you like the service (we hope you do) just continue using it and you’ll be charged on whichever billing interval (monthly or yearly) you selected. If you don’t like Threshold, just cancel your project before your 45 day free trial ends and you won’t be charged at all.</p>
          <h3>Are there sign up fees? Termination fees? Any hidden fees?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely not. We think one-time extra fees aren’t the right way to do business. We don’t charge signup fees, termination fees, or any additional fees. The price you pay is simply the fixed monthly or yearly fee based on the plan you’ve chosen.</p>
          <h3>My project is 18 months. What are my options?</h3>
          <p>We suggest you pay for a yearly plan and then switch to a monthly plan before your yearly plan runs out. We'll send out an email a few days before you're billed again to let you know that a yearly payment is scheduled. This way you'll gain the savings of a yearly plan while not having to pay for 24 months of service.</p>
          <h3>What can the Threshold project owner do that other users can't? How do I change the project owner?</h3>
          <p>The Threshold project owner is the only person that can access the Project Settings page, upgrade, downgrade, change billing information, access invoices, and cancel the project. To change the project owner, click the “Edit Project” button on your project dashboard.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_edit.jpg" />
          <p>From there select Transfer Ownership.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_transfer.jpg" />
          <h3>Can you bill us and then we'll write you a check?</h3>
          <p>Sorry, we can only accept payment via Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diner's Club, and JCB.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="managing-your-project" class="subsection">
          <h2>Managing Your Project</h2>
          <p>Learn about your options for making changes to your project’s billing settings.</p>
          <h3>Where can I make changes to my plan?</h3>
          <p>To change your project’s plan, click the “Edit Project” button on your project dashboard.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_edit.jpg" />
          <p>After that  select  the “Change Your Plan” tab.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_change.jpg" />
          <h3>What happens if I upgrade to a higher plan:</h3>
          <p>If you upgrade in the middle of a billing cycle, you will be moved to the higher plan immediately. We’ll charge you for the new plan's full amount but also apply a credit for your unused time on your previous plan. For example, imagine as a user you are 15 days into you billing cycle. You currently pay $9.99 per month and you want to upgrade to a $49.99 per month plan. Your current plan has 15 days left on the billing cycle. This equates to about $4.99 worth of service. When you upgrade you'll start a new billing cycle and your first payment will be $45.00 ($49.99 - $4.99). After the initial month you'll then be billed the full $49.99 going forward.</p>
          <h3>What happens if I downgrade to a lower plan:</h3>
          <p>If you downgrade in the middle of a billing cycle, you will be moved to the lower plan immediately. We will charge you for the new plan's full amount but apply a credit for your unused time on your previous plan. For example, imagine as a user you are 15 days into you billing cycle. You currently pay $49.99 per month and you want to downgrade to a $9.99 per month plan. Your current plan has 15 days left on the billing cycle. This equates to about $24.99 worth of service. When you downgrade you'll start a new billing cycle and we'll apply the credit. Often times this means your account credit will exceed your new plan's total amount and you won’t be charged at all. We'll continue to apply credits until your credit runs out.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot downgrade to a plan unless your project has fewer photos than the new plan permits.</p>
          <h3>Changing billing intervals:</h3>
          <p>Threshold allows you to change your billing interval at any time. When you change your billing interval you must enter your credit card details again.</p>
          <p>Monthly to Yearly: If you change your billing cycle from a monthly plan to a yearly plan you'll be billed for the yearly plan immediately but a credit for your unused time on your monthly plan will be applied.</p>
          <p>Yearly to Monthly: If you change your billing cycle from a yearly plan to a monthly plan you'll be billed for any difference immediately. Often times this results in having a large credit for unused time that exceeds the cost of the monthly plan you’re switching to. We'll continue to apply the credit each month until it runs out.</p>
          <h3>How can I change my credit card?</h3>
          <p>To change the credit card, click the Update Card Details tab.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_change.jpg" />
          <h3>Do my unused photos roll over to the next billing cycle?</h3>
          <p>No they do not. Billing is linked to a fixed number of total photos. For example, if you pay $9.99 per month for 1,000 photos and you’re only using 200 photos, your plan's photo limit doesn't increase to 1,800 photos on the next billing cycle. This also applies to yearly plans. For example, If you’re using 800 photos and you’re signed up for a 1,000 photo plan, at the beginning of your second year you still can only have a total of 1,000 photos on your project before you reach your plan's photo limit.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="end-of-project" class="subsection">
          <h2>End of Project</h2>
          <p>This section will cover what to do when your project ends or if you want to cancel your project.</p>
          <h3>I want to cancel my project / plan:</h3>
          <p>You can cancel your project at any time. We'll stop your billing cycle immediately and you won't be billed again. Cancelling your project will remove your project from Threshold. You can also download your project photos and plans before you cancel (coming soon).</p>
          <p>Cancel your project by clicking the Edit Project button on your project dashboard.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_edit.jpg" />
          <p>In the Project Settings tab you can cancel / delete your project.</p>
          <img src="img/help/billing_delete.jpg" />
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Once your project is deleted, all photo, and plan data will be immediately and permanently deleted. If you want to keep your project online you can also archive your project.</p>
          <h3>How does archiving work?</h3>
          <p>Archiving your project lets you keep your project online for a low fee based on your project's storage.  Archiving is great as an-end of-project deliverable or if your project gets delayed but you know you’ll want to pick up again later. You can un-archive your project at any time.</p>
          <p>Archiving is currently a Beta feature and is free to use. Pricing will be extremely low when this does become a paid feature. An archived project won't allow users to upload photos or plans. There may be other differences down the road but for now uploading is the only difference.</p>
          <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
          <p>We offer a free trial period on your first project, but after that there are no refunds. Here’s how it works: Your initial bill comes 45 days after you create your project. If you cancel your project before this initial billing, you won’t be charged. If you cancel after your initial billing, we’ll stop charging your card in the future, but no refunds will be issued. For example, if your billing cycle is on the 18th of every month, and you cancel on the 24th, you’ll still have to pay for the current month, but you won’t be charged again after that. We always bill upfront and there are no refunds for unused time or photos at the end of your project.</p>
